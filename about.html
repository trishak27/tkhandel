        <h3>HELLO !!</h3>
        <p class="description">I am a Technical Support Analyst working for the Federal Government and living in Conception Bay South, Newfoundland. Photography has always been a hobby of mine, and five years ago, I discovered a new passion for wildlife photography. As a child, I was fascinated by animals and enjoyed learning about them through documentaries and National Geographic magazines. However, it wasn't until I picked up a digital camera that I realized how fulfilling it was to capture these animals' beauty and study their behavior through photography.</p>
        <p>My love for wildlife photography was sparked by a chance encounter with a Great Blue Heron in Ottawa. Even though I didn't have a high-quality telephoto lens, I was determined to get closer to capture the bird's beauty and learn more about it. This experience marked the beginning of my journey as a wildlife photographer.</p>
        <p> After some significant life changes, I returned home to Newfoundland in 2010, where I continued to pursue my passion for wildlife photography. My goal is to showcase Newfoundland's rugged landscape and the amazing array of wildlife that call it home, especially birds. Through my photography, I hope to inspire people to appreciate and protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats.</p>
        <p>My work in wildlife photography has received recognition from international publications such as BBC Wildlife Magazine, L'image Magazine, iBird App, and Canadian Geographic Magazine's Best of Birds 2015. Additionally, I have authored a book titled "Beauty of Nature" which features a collection of my photographs capturing various bird species found on the island. The book not only showcases my work but also provides helpful tips and information for aspiring wildlife photographers, including a list of the best locations on the island to capture wildlife. To purchase a copy, please visit the "Book - Beauty of Nature" link in the sidebar.</p>
